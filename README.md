# CSSE-Survival-Kit

A collection of everything that I or my classmates found to have carried me through my Computer Science degree program at Auburn University. Whether its a niche YouTube chanel, a set of notes, some random repo that came up on a google search, or a website I stumbled upon, my goal is to try and capture everything I found here to save you all the time I spent scrolling and googling.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Tyler Teufel, and, at the time that I am writing this, I am a Senior / 4th year Comp Sci student at Auburn University. I am originally from Long Island, NY, but have spent the last 3 and a half (ish) years studying down in Auburn, AL, as I am sure you probably put together already.
