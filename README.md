A collection of everything that I or my classmates found to have carried me through my Computer Science degree program at Auburn University. Whether its a niche YouTube chanel, a set of notes, some random repo that came up on a google search, or a website I stumbled upon, my goal is to try and capture everything I found here to save you all the time I spent scrolling and googling.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Tyler Teufel, and, at the time that I am writing this, I am a Senior / 4th year Comp Sci student at Auburn University. I am originally from Long Island, NY, but have spent the last 3 and a half (ish) years studying down in Auburn, AL. After I graduate this coming May (2025), I will begin working full time as a Software Engineer for LPL Financial. In the mean time, I want to share some of the most helpful resources I came across, and cool projects I worked on throughout my time as an undergrad student.

The only knowledge I came to Auburn with was whatever I was able to learn in AP Computer Science A amidst the 2020 pandemic my junior year in High School, so I can safely say that everything I include here is coming straight from the experience of your average CSSE student.
