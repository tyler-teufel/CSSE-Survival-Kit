A collection of everything that I or my classmates found to have carried me through my Computer Science degree program at Auburn University. Whether its a niche YouTube chanel, a set of notes, some random repo that came up on a google search, or a website I stumbled upon, my goal is to try and capture everything I found here to save you all the time I spent scrolling and googling.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Tyler Teufel, and, at the time that I am writing this, I am a Senior / 4th year Comp Sci student at Auburn University. I am originally from Long Island, NY, but have spent the last 3 and a half (ish) years studying down in Auburn, AL. After I graduate this coming May (2025), I will begin working full time as a Software Engineer for LPL Financial. In the mean time, I want to share some of the most helpful resources I came across, and cool projects I worked on throughout my time as an undergrad student.

The only knowledge I came to Auburn with was whatever I was able to learn in AP Computer Science A amidst the 2020 pandemic my junior year in High School, so I can safely say that everything I include here is coming straight from the experience of your average CSSE student.

# Firstly, Git

## So I know GitHub, but why git?

One of the most crucial skills I learned both in class and at my internships was the value of version control. Learning git can empower you to really begin to hit the ground running with your own projects, both for the sake of making them accessible via a remote repository site like GitHub, as well as for learning to make incremental changes in stages using branching for personal and collaborative work.

Git is without a doubt one of the most crucial skills to have when you go into this industry. At my first software development internship, I think the very first thing they had me get ramped up on was proficiency with git, (we used Bitbucket for our remote repos), and learning the branching conventions and merging policies for each project that I might touch.

Even if you feel like you know GitHub, its crucial to make sure you know Git. Thats how I was a few years ago.

## Resources

If you click the link below, you will be directed to a file I created with some concise instructions on where to install Git on your machine, as well as links to some really helpful videos and websites (including the official git guide) to help you get ramped up!

I cannot stress the importance of git enough, please take your time to learn and understand this while still a student!
